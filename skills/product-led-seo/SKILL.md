# Product-Led SEO

## What It Is

Product-Led SEO is a framework that treats SEO as a product discipline, not just a marketing tactic. The core insight: **SEO success comes from building products that serve searcher intent, not from creating content optimized for keywords.**

The traditional approach to SEO is "find keywords, write content, build links." Product-Led SEO asks: "What is the user searching for, and what product experience will satisfy that search?"

This framework was developed by Eli Schwartz, who helped companies like Zapier, Tinder, Quora, and SurveyMonkey build SEO strategies that generated hundreds of millions in revenue. The key shift: Move from "How do we rank for this keyword?" to "What product does this searcher need?"

## When to Use It

Use Product-Led SEO when you need to:

- **Decide if SEO is worth investing in** for your business model
- **Develop an SEO strategy** that actually converts (not just drives traffic)
- **Build programmatic pages** at scale (like Zapier, Zillow, or TripAdvisor)
- **Evaluate your SEO approach** in the age of AI Overviews and LLMs
- **Shift from top-of-funnel content** to mid-funnel conversion
- **Get product and marketing aligned** on search strategy
- **Understand the real ROI** of your SEO investment

## When Not to Use It

- **No SEO journey exists**: If users don't search for your solution (most B2B SaaS)
- **Committee decisions**: Enterprise sales with long buying cycles rarely convert from SEO
- **Brand-driven discovery**: If your product requires brand awareness first
- **You need fast results**: SEO takes months to years
- **Local businesses with no online transaction

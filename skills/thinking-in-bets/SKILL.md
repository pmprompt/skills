# Thinking in Bets

## What It Is

Thinking in Bets is a framework for improving decision quality by separating **decisions from outcomes**. The core insight: **a good decision can have a bad outcome, and a bad decision can have a good outcome—luck is always involved.**

Most people judge decisions by their outcomes (called "resulting"). This is backwards. You can only control the quality of your decision, not the outcome.

The key shifts:
- Move from "Was I right?" to "Was my thinking process good?"
- Move from "What happened?" to "What did I know at the time?"
- Move from implicit assumptions to explicit, testable beliefs

## When to Use It

Use Thinking in Bets when you need to:

- **Evaluate past decisions** without outcome bias clouding judgment
- **Make decisions under uncertainty** where luck will influence results
- **Improve team decision-making** in meetings and planning
- **Set up pre-mortems and kill criteria** for projects
- **Shorten feedback loops** on decisions with delayed outcomes
- **Reduce cognitive biases** like overconfidence, hindsight bias, and sunk cost
- **Run better meetings** that surface true opinions, not groupthink

## When Not to Use It

- The decision is trivial with low stakes
- You have perfect information (rare)
- You're looking for permission to take a risk you've already decided on

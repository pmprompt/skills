name: growth-loops
description: Use when asked to "growth loops", "build a growth engine", "design a viral loop", "create a content loop", "move beyond paid acquisition", or "why isn't growth compounding". Helps design self-reinforcing growth systems where output becomes input. The Growth Loops framework (from Brian Balfour / Reforge and Elena Verna) shifts thinking from linear funnels to compounding loops.

# Growth Loops

## What It Is

Growth Loops is a framework for building sustainable, compounding growth. The core insight: **the best growth systems are loops, not funnels — where the output of one cycle becomes the input for the next.**

Traditional growth thinking focuses on funnels: acquire users at the top, optimize conversion through stages, and measure output at the bottom. But funnels are linear. You pour effort in, you get results out, and then you start over. Loops are different: each cycle generates the fuel for the next cycle.

The key shift: Move from asking "How do we get more users?" to asking "How does each user we acquire generate more users?"

## When to Use It

Use Growth Loops when you need to:

- **Design your core growth engine** before or after product-market fit
- **Move beyond paid acquisition** to more sustainable growth
- **Understand why growth isn't compounding** despite acquisition efforts
- **Build virality, content, or sales loops** into your product
- **Evaluate distribution strategies** for a new product or feature
- **Diagnose why your "growth team" isn't producing results**
- **Plan how to capitalize on new distribution platforms** (like ChatGPT)

## When Not to Use It

- You haven't validated that anyone wants your product (find PMF first)
- You're optimizing micro-conversions without a growth model
- You're looking for "growth hacks" rather than systematic growth
- Your product has no natural mechanism for users to generate more users

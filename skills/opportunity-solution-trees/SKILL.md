# Opportunity Solution Trees

## What It Is

Use the Opportunity Solution Tree (OST) to connect a business outcome to the customer opportunities that drive it, then compare solutions and tests. The tree forces you to separate needs from ideas and keeps discovery tied to delivery.

## When to Use It

- Structure discovery around customer opportunities
- Tie customer needs to measurable outcomes
- Compare multiple solutions for the same opportunity
- Keep continuous discovery aligned with the roadmap
- Create a shared view of priorities with stakeholders

## When Not to Use It

- You are not doing customer research
- The solution is already decided
- The work is a commodity requirement with no real options
- You only need a quick one-off decision

## Core Structure

- Outcome: the business result you are responsible for achieving
- Opportunities: unmet customer needs, pains, or desires
- Solutions: multiple ideas that address one opportunity
- Experiments: tests that validate the riskiest assumptions

## How to Apply It

1. Define a measurable outcome.
2. Map the customer journey to frame opportunity areas.
3. Capture opportunities from real interviews (stories, not preferences).
4. Organize opportunities into a tree from broad to specific.
5. Generate at least three solutions per high-priority opportunity.
6. Test the riskiest assumptions before building.
7. Review and update the tree weekly.

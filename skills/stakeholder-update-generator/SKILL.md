# Stakeholder Update Generator

## When to Use
- Shipping a new feature or product update
- Need to communicate progress to stakeholders
- Writing release notes for users
- Preparing status updates for leadership
- Documenting what changed in a sprint or milestone

## What This Skill Does
Creates engaging, well-structured updates that communicate what shipped, why it matters, and what comes next.

## Instructions
Help me write an engaging update for [product/feature/sprint] that is both informative and compelling. Include:

1. High-level summary (2-3 sentences)
2. Key accomplishments or new features
   - Feature/item name
   - Brief description
   - User benefit and impact
3. Improvements and fixes
4. Metrics or results (if available)
5. What's next

Style preference: [Professional/Casual/Technical]
Audience: [Users/Leadership/Engineering/Investors]

Changes to document:
[List what shipped, improvements made, or progress achieved]

## Best Practices
- Lead with the most impactful changes
- Focus on user benefits, not technical details (unless technical audience)
- Use concrete metrics when possible ("50% faster" not "performance improvements")
- Keep the tone consistent with your brand
- Include visuals or screenshots if possible (note them in the text)
- Add a call-to-action if relevant

## Example
**Input:** Shipped notification center, improved search performance, fixed 15 bugs
**Output:** Structured update highlighting "Never miss an important update" (notification center benefits), "Find anything in seconds" (search improvements), professional tone, metrics included (3x faster search), next steps mentioned

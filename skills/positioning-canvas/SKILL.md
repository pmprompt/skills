# Positioning Canvas

## What It Is

Positioning defines how your product is the best in the world at delivering some value that a well-defined set of customers care a lot about.

**The core insight:** Positioning is not messaging. It's not your tagline. It's the fundamental strategic decision about how you win in the market — what you compete against, how you're different, what value only you can deliver, and who cares most about that value.

When positioning is weak:
- Prospects don't understand what you are on first contact
- Sales calls require 3+ meetings before "the light comes on"
- You win deals but customers churn because expectations didn't match reality
- Different teams (sales, marketing, product) tell different stories

When positioning is strong:
- It feels obvious — "of course that's what it is"
- Qualified prospects immediately understand why they should care
- Your differentiated value is clear against alternatives
- Everyone in the company tells the same story

## When to Use It

Use Positioning Canvas when you need to:

- **Define or refine how you compete** — who are the real alternatives?
- **Articulate differentiated value** — why pick you over everything else?
- **Identify your best-fit customers** — who cares most about your value?
- **Choose or validate your market category** — what context makes your value obvious?
- **Align your team** — get sales, marketing, product, and leadership on the same page
- **Build a sales pitch** — translate positioning into a story that wins deals
- **Reposition after market changes** — your product evolved, competition shifted, or customers changed

## When Not to Use It

- **You're pre-product-market-fit** — Keep positioning loose until you see patterns in who loves you and why.
- **You want to validate a hypothesis** — Positioning captures what's true today based on evidence.
- **You're only focused on messaging** — Positioning is an input to messaging, not messaging itself.

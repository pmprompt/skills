# Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

## What It Is

Jobs-to-be-Done is a framework for understanding customer motivation. The core insight: **people don't buy products, they hire them to make progress in their lives.**

When someone buys a product, they're not buying features or benefits—they're hiring that product to do a job. Understanding that job unlocks everything: positioning, messaging, feature prioritization, and competitive strategy.

The key shift: Move from asking "What do customers want?" to asking "What progress are customers trying to make?"

## When to Use It

Use JTBD when you need to:

- **Understand why customers buy** (not just what they buy)
- **Discover your true competitive set** (often not who you think)
- **Find product-market fit** for a new product or feature
- **Improve positioning and messaging** that resonates
- **Reduce churn** by understanding why customers leave
- **Prioritize your roadmap** based on real customer progress
- **Identify new market opportunities** through struggling moments

## When Not to Use It

- There's no real customer choice (e.g., employer-mandated software)
- The purchase is pure habit with no conscious decision
- You want to validate a hypothesis you've already decided on

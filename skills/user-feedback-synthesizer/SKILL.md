# User Feedback Synthesizer

## When to Use
- After conducting user interviews or surveys
- When you have a backlog of support tickets to analyze
- To identify common pain points from feedback across multiple sources
- Before planning your product roadmap to understand user needs

## What This Skill Does
Analyzes user feedback data to extract insights, cluster themes, identify severity levels, and provide actionable recommendations that inform product decisions.

## Instructions
Act as a user research expert. Help me analyze this collection of user feedback by:

1. Clustering feedback into themes
2. Identifying severity levels for each theme
3. Suggesting potential solutions
4. Prioritizing issues by impact and frequency
5. Highlighting quick wins

## Best Practices
- Include context about your product and target users
- Mix feedback from multiple sources (interviews, support tickets, surveys, reviews)
- Look for patterns across different user segments
- Note the frequency of each pain point
- Validate insights with follow-up questions to users

## Example
**Input:** 50 support tickets about onboarding + 20 user interview transcripts
**Output:** 3 main themes identified (unclear value proposition, confusing UI, missing integrations), prioritized by impact with specific solution recommendations and estimated effort

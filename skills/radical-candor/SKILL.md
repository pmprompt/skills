# Radical Candor

## What It Is

Radical Candor is a framework for giving feedback that builds trust and drives results. The core insight: **great feedback happens when you Care Personally AND Challenge Directly at the same time.**

Most people fail at feedback because they choose one or the other. They're either so focused on being nice that they don't say what needs to be said (ruinous empathy), or they're so focused on being direct that they forget to show they care (obnoxious aggression). Radical Candor isn't about finding a middle ground—it's about doing both fully.

The key shift: Move from "How do I deliver this feedback?" to "How do I help this person succeed?"

## When to Use It

Use Radical Candor when you need to:

- **Give feedback** (both praise and criticism) that actually lands
- **Have difficult performance conversations** with direct reports
- **Build a culture of honest communication** on your team
- **Solicit feedback** from others about your own performance
- **Coach employees** through growth and development
- **Address problems** before they become crises
- **Build trust** in professional relationships

## When Not to Use It

- **When you don't actually care** — if you just want to vent or hurt someone
- **When the feedback is about unchangeable personal traits** — focus on behavior, not personality
- **When you haven't solicited feedback first** — always start by asking for feedback
- **When you're saving it for a performance review** — Radical Candor happens in the moment

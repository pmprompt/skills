# Working Backwards

## What It Is

Working Backwards is Amazon's product development methodology. The core insight: **start with the customer problem and work backward to the solution, not the other way around.**

Most teams work forward: "We have this technology/capability/idea — what can we build with it?" Working Backwards inverts this: "What problem does the customer have? What would the ideal solution look like? Now, how do we build it?"

The mechanism: Write an internal press release and FAQ *before* building anything. If you can't write a compelling press release, you don't have a compelling product.

As Jeff Bezos put it: "We took it as an article of faith — if we served customers well, if we prioritized customers and delivered for them, things like sales, revenue, and free cash flow would follow."

## When to Use It

Use Working Backwards when you need to:

- **Define a new product or major feature** before committing resources
- **Evaluate competing product ideas** and choose which to build
- **Align stakeholders** on what you're building and why
- **Force clarity** on vague product concepts
- **Prevent building solutions in search of problems**
- **Create a shared vision** that engineering, design, and leadership can rally around
- **Decide whether an idea is worth pursuing** at all

## When Not to Use It

- The work is incremental optimization (A/B tests, bug fixes)
- You're executing on an already-defined product
- The scope is too small to warrant the overhead

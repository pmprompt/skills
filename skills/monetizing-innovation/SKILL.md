# Monetizing Innovation

## What It Is

Monetizing Innovation is a framework for designing products that customers need, value, AND are willing to pay for. The core insight: **price is not a number you slap on at the end — it's a measure of value that should guide what you build from the start.**

The key shift: Move from "build the product, then figure out pricing" to "understand willingness to pay, then design the product around it."

72% of innovations fail from a monetization perspective — not because the product is bad, but because companies never validated that customers would actually pay for it.

**Credit:** This framework is based on *Monetizing Innovation* by Madhavan Ramanujam and Georg Tacke of Simon-Kucher & Partners, the world's leading pricing strategy consulting firm.

## When to Use It

Use Monetizing Innovation when you need to:

- **Validate product ideas** before investing engineering resources
- **Prioritize your roadmap** based on what drives willingness to pay
- **Choose a pricing model** (subscription, usage, hybrid, outcome-based)
- **Design packaging tiers** (good/better/best) that convert
- **Increase revenue** without building new features
- **Avoid leaving money on the table** or underpricing
- **Prepare for price negotiations** in B2B sales
- **Navigate pricing in a downturn** without destroying value

## When Not to Use It

- **Commoditized markets** where you have no pricing power
- **Regulated pricing** environments (healthcare, utilities)
- **Very early discovery** — you need a product concept to test
- **Consumer products with pure network effects** where monetization must wait

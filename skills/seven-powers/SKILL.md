# 7 Powers: The Foundations of Business Strategy

## What It Is

7 Powers is a framework for understanding sustainable competitive advantage. The core insight: **Business value comes from possessing an attribute that produces higher returns than competitors AND a barrier that prevents competitors from arbitraging it away.**

Power = Benefit + Barrier

Warren Buffett famously said: "In business, I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable moats." Power is understanding what makes something a castle (the benefit) versus a shack, and what makes the moat unbreachable (the barrier).

The key shift: Move from asking "What's our competitive advantage?" to asking "What economic structure creates durable differential returns?"

## When to Use It

Use 7 Powers when you need to:

- **Evaluate a business's long-term defensibility** (investment decisions, competitive analysis)
- **Design a startup for durability** (not just product-market fit)
- **Understand why incumbents can't respond** to your disruptive move
- **Prioritize strategic initiatives** based on what builds power
- **Identify whether you actually have a moat** or just operational excellence
- **Plan second acts** (new business lines that could develop power)
- **Win market share battles** in high-growth phases

## When Not to Use It

- You don't have product-market fit yet
- The business is purely commodity with no differentiation possible
- You want to justify a strategy you've already decided on
- You're optimizing operations (power is about structure, not execution)

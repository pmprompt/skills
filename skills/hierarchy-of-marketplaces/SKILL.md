# Hierarchy of Marketplaces

## What It Is

The Hierarchy of Marketplaces is a framework for building defensible marketplace businesses. The core insight: **GMV is a vanity metric. Happy GMV is what matters.**

Most marketplace founders race to grow GMV as fast as possible, spreading resources thin across markets and categories. This is backwards. The path to a dominant, profitable marketplace requires working through three levels in sequence:

1. **Focus** - Constrain your market to a "thimble" and achieve minimum viable happiness
2. **Tip** - Reach saturation in your focused market until it tips in your favor
3. **Dominate** - Only then expand to adjacent markets and categories

The key shift: Move from asking "How do we grow GMV?" to asking "How do we make both sides of our marketplace so happy they retain?"

## When to Use It

Use the Hierarchy of Marketplaces when you need to:

- **Launch a new marketplace** and decide where to focus
- **Diagnose why growth is stalling** despite increasing GMV
- **Decide when to expand** to new markets or categories
- **Evaluate marketplace health** beyond top-line metrics
- **Compete against incumbents** with more resources
- **Raise funding** and demonstrate real marketplace value
- **Choose between depth and breadth** in your growth strategy

## When Not to Use It

- You're building a product without two-sided network effects
- You have unlimited capital and no competition (rare)
- The market has no potential for winner-take-most dynamics
- You're optimizing a mature, already-dominant marketplace

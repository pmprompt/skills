name: shape-up
description: Use when asked to "shape up", "run a shaping session", "set an appetite", "scope a project without estimates", "betting table", or "ship in fixed cycles". Helps teams escape estimate-driven development and Scrum fatigue. The Shape Up method (created by Ryan Singer at Basecamp/37signals) uses fixed time boxes, variable scope, and collaborative shaping to ship meaningful work predictably.

# Shape Up

## What It Is

Shape Up is a product development methodology built on one core insight: **you cannot estimate your way to shipping—you must shape your way there.**

Traditional approaches ask "How long will this take?" and then try to hit that estimate. Shape Up flips this: decide upfront how much time you're willing to spend (the *appetite*), then shape a version of the solution that fits within that constraint.

The methodology emerged from 17 years of building Basecamp, where the founding team faced an unusual constraint: their only engineer (DHH) worked just 10 hours per week. This forced extreme clarity about what to build and ruthless scoping to ensure every hour counted.

**The key shift:** Move from "What's the estimate for this?" to "What version of this can we confidently ship in the time we're willing to spend?"

## When to Use It

Use Shape Up when you need to:

- **Stop projects from dragging** — work that should take weeks is taking months
- **Escape the estimate trap** — you're tired of estimates that are always wrong
- **Give teams real autonomy** — not just ticket execution
- **Reduce meeting overhead** — Scrum rituals are consuming your time
- **Ship meaningful chunks** — not just incremental tickets
- **Align product and engineering** — there's a wall between them today
- **Maintain startup speed** — as you scale past 30-50 people

## When Not to Use It

- You're 3 people or fewer — just talk to each other
- There's no real complexity
- You can't get engineering into shaping
- Leadership isn't bought in
- You're doing pure maintenance

# Product-Led Growth (PLG)

## What It Is

Product-Led Growth is a go-to-market strategy where the product itself drives acquisition, activation, retention, and monetization. Instead of relying on sales to close deals before users can try the product, PLG lets users experience value first and buy later.

The core insight: **In PLG, the product does the selling.** Users sign up, experience value through self-serve, and either convert themselves or become qualified leads for sales.

PLG is fundamentally **Data-Led Growth (DLG)**. When you give away a free product, you get two things in exchange: broader reach (lower barrier to entry) and usage data that tells you which features correlate with conversion and retention. Without this data foundation, you're giving away your product for nothing.

## When to Use It

Use PLG frameworks when you need to:

- **Design a freemium or free trial model** for a B2B SaaS product
- **Add self-serve to a sales-led product** to expand reach
- **Optimize conversion** from free to paid users
- **Define product-qualified leads (PQLs)** for your sales team
- **Reduce customer acquisition cost** through self-serve
- **Build a hybrid PLG + sales motion** (product-led sales)
- **Diagnose why free users aren't converting** to paid

## When Not to Use It

- **Highly complex products requiring customization**
- **Very small addressable market**
- **No individual use case exists**
- **You lack data infrastructure**
- **You want instant revenue impact** — PLG takes 12+ months

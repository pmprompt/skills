# The Hooked Model

## What It Is

The Hooked Model is a framework for building products that create unprompted user engagement. The core insight: **habit-forming products connect to internal triggers through a repeating cycle of trigger, action, reward, and investment.**

When a product becomes a habit, users engage without external prompts. They don't need ads, emails, or notifications to come back. They return because the product has become their automatic response to an internal trigger like boredom, loneliness, uncertainty, or FOMO.

The key shift: Move from asking "How do we get users to open the app?" to asking "What internal trigger do we want to own, and how do we become the automatic response to it?"

## When to Use It

Use the Hooked Model when you need to:

- **Design features that drive repeat engagement** (not just one-time use)
- **Reduce dependency on external marketing** to bring users back
- **Improve retention and decrease churn** through habit formation
- **Understand why competitor products are so sticky** (reverse-engineer their hooks)
- **Create ethical engagement** that genuinely improves users' lives
- **Prioritize which features to build** based on habit potential
- **Increase customer lifetime value** through deeper product integration

## When Not to Use It

- The product is inherently infrequent (e.g., buying a house, annual insurance)
- Users should consciously evaluate each decision (e.g., financial trading, medical diagnosis)
- Habit formation would harm users rather than help them

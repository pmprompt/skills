# OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)

## What It Is

OKRs are a goal-setting framework that creates focus, alignment, and a learning cycle for teams and organizations. The core insight: **set one ambitious objective per quarter with 2-3 measurable key results, then check in weekly to maintain focus.**

The key shift: Move from tracking activities ("What are we doing?") to tracking outcomes ("What progress are we making toward our goals?").

OKRs are a vitamin, not a medicine. They supercharge companies that already have their fundamentals in place (strategy, empowered teams, psychological safety). They won't fix broken organizations - they'll just reveal what's broken.

## When to Use It

Use OKRs when you need to:

- **Focus the team** on the single most important thing for the quarter
- **Align the organization** so everyone knows what matters most
- **Create accountability** with measurable outcomes (not just activities)
- **Build a learning cycle** through weekly check-ins and quarterly retrospectives
- **Scale leadership** so founders/executives don't need to micromanage
- **Accelerate progress** by avoiding the "peanut butter" problem of spreading effort too thin

## When Not to Use It

- You don't have a clear strategy (OKRs reveal missing strategy, they don't replace it)
- Your company lacks psychological safety
- You want to track ALL the work (OKRs are for priorities, not comprehensive task lists)
- Teams aren't empowered to decide HOW to achieve outcomes
